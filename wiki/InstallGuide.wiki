At the moment only install instructions exist for linux. Please see the [FutureDevelopment Future Development] page for details on future plans for porting the project to other platforms such as Windows and MacOS. All dependencies are cross-platform, so in theory porting (even to Windows) should be easy.

To compile the project on your computer, you must have [http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/ OpenCV] installed and also the [http://www.boost.org/ Boost] libraries.
