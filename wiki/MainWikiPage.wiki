#summary Wiki - home.

= Introduction =

Hopefully this wiki will never need to be very big, but I'm a huge fan of good documentation so I do plan to develop it once my code actually goes up on the website.

= Details =

The wiki will eventually include the following:

  * Simple install guide (it should be extremely easy to install)
  * Guide on how to use the system for calibration
  * Link to calibration mask templates
  * Link to calibration test data
  * Discussion for future development
