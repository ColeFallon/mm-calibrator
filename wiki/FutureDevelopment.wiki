#summary This page outlines suggested paths for future development.

= Introduction =

Some (but not all) of these directions for future development I intend to pursue myself. If anyone else would like to contribute to any items on this list, or make additional suggestions, this would be very welcome!


= Future Software Development =

  * Live capture mode
  * Port project to Windows
  * Port project to MacOS
  * Integrate with a [http://www.ros.org/wiki/ ROS] package (e.g perhaps [http://www.ros.org/wiki/camera_calibration this] one?)

= Future Algorithm Development =
  * Improve Shape filter (use the ratio of principal axis lengths of an elliptic fit)
  * Local acutance-based point rejection
  * Region-weighted projection error
  * Add 3< camera calibration support
  * Wide-baseline camera setup support (including absolute referencing)
  * Add new distortion models for different types of cameras
  * Automatically estimate pattern dimensions
  * Add a frame quality measure
  * Improve Enhanced-MCM algorithm for automatic frame selection
  * Add a centroid-only mode
  * Soft-synchronization option for cameras
  * Auto-calibration option using Manhattan assumption
  * Add rectification error as an alternative to reprojection error for extrinsic calibration
